            "The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has been pondered by humans for centuries. There is no one definitive answer, as the meaning of life can be subjective and vary from person to person. However, some common themes that emerge when discussing the meaning of life include:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Purpose and Fulfillment:** Many people believe that the meaning of life is to find a purpose or calling that brings them fulfillment. This could involve pursuing a career, raising a family, or engaging in creative or intellectual activities.\n",
            "**Connection and Relationships:** Others believe that the meaning of life is found in the connections we make with others. This includes building strong relationships with family, friends, and loved ones, as well as contributing to a larger community or society.\n",
            "**Personal Growth and Development:** Some people believe that the meaning of life is to grow and develop as a person. This can involve learning new skills, exploring different perspectives, and challenging oneself to become a better version of oneself.\n",
            "**Experiences and Moments:** Others believe that the meaning of life is found in the experiences and moments we have throughout our lives. This could include travel, adventure, trying new things, and simply appreciating the beauty of the world around us.\n",
            "**Legacy and Impact:** For some people, the meaning of life is to leave a lasting legacy or impact on the world. This could involve making a difference in the lives of others, contributing to society, or creating something that will be remembered long after we are gone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, the meaning of life is a personal journey that each individual must explore for themselves. There is no right or wrong answer, and the meaning of life can change and evolve as we grow and experience more.\n"

I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.' metadata={'source': '/content/pg_essay.txt'}\n",

I knew intellectually that people made art — that it didn't just appear spontaneously — but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.\\n\\nThat fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\\n\\nSo now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.\" metadata={'source': '/content/pg_essay.txt'}\n",

            "page_content='There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\\n\\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn\\'t much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]' metadata={'source': '/content/pg_essay.txt'}\n",

I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.' metadata={'source': '/content/pg_essay.txt'}\n",

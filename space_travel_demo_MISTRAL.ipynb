            "Okay, I need to think about Cuban poets. I know that Cuba has a rich literary tradition, so there must be several prominent poets to consider.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I recall that José Martí is often mentioned in the context of Cuban literature. He's not just a poet but also a national hero and symbol of Cuba's struggle for independence. His works, like \"Versos sencillos,\" are well-known and highly regarded.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there's Nicolás Guillén, who is celebrated for his contributions to Afro-Cuban poetry. His work often explores themes of racial identity and social justice, which are significant in Cuban culture.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another name that comes to mind is Dulce María Loynaz. She won the Cervantes Prize, which is a prestigious award in the Spanish-speaking world. Her poetry is known for its lyrical beauty and emotional depth.\n",
            "\n",
            "But who is the best? That's a subjective question. It depends on what criteria we're using: influence, literary merit, cultural impact, etc. José Martí is often considered the national poet of Cuba, which might give him an edge in terms of cultural significance.\n",
            "\n",
            "But let's think about other prominent poets as well. There's also Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, who was a significant figure in the 19th century. Her work is notable, but she might not be as widely recognized today.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there's Virgilio Piñera, known for his avant-garde style and existential themes. His work is quite influential, but perhaps more in the realm of theater and prose.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that Martí is often referred to as the national poet and his works are deeply ingrained in Cuban culture, it's reasonable to consider him the best Cuban poet. However, it's important to note that \"best\" is subjective and others might prefer Guillén or Loynaz based on personal taste or specific criteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "But for a general answer, especially considering cultural impact and historical significance, José Martí seems to be the most prominent figure.\n",
            "\n",
            "But just to be sure, I should think about other poets. What about Eliseo Diego? He was also a notable poet, but his recognition might not be as widespread as Martí's.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another name is Heberto Padilla, known for his controversial works during the Cuban Revolution.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Martí's influence extends beyond poetry into the realm of national identity and political thought, which makes him a strong candidate for the title of \"best\" Cuban poet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But is it fair to call someone the \"best\"? Poetry is so subjective. Maybe it's better to list some of the most prominent ones and let the user decide. But the problem asks for the best, so perhaps Martí is the most widely accepted answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, I recall that Nicolás Guillén is often praised for his unique style and impact on Afro-Cuban identity. Maybe in terms of literary innovation, Guillén stands out.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is a tough question. Maybe I should consider awards and international recognition. Dulce María Loynaz won the Cervantes Prize, which is a big deal in the Spanish-speaking world. That might make her a strong candidate.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Martí is often called the national poet, which is a significant title. Maybe he's the best-known and most celebrated.\n",
            "\n",
            "But is \"best\" about fame or about literary quality? It's a bit ambiguous. Maybe I should think about who is most studied and celebrated in literary circles.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at academic and literary criticism, both Martí and Guillén are highly regarded. Martí for his role in Cuban independence and his literary contributions, and Guillén for his poetic innovation and cultural representation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps it's a tie between Martí and Guillén. But since the question asks for the best, and Martí is more of a national symbol, maybe he is the answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for more information or think about other poets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, what about Reinaldo Arenas? He was a prominent poet and writer, known for his powerful and often controversial works. But he might be more famous for his novels than his poetry.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to consider who is most commonly cited as the greatest Cuban poet in literary discussions and histories.\n",
            "\n",
            "From what I recall, José Martí is often placed at the forefront of Cuban literature. So perhaps he is the answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "But to be thorough, I should consider that \"best\" can be subjective. Some might argue for Guillén or Loynaz based on different criteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that, perhaps the most objective answer is to list the most prominent Cuban poets and acknowledge that deciding the \"best\" is subjective.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the problem asks for the best, so I need to choose one. Given Martí's status as a national hero and his significant contributions to poetry, he might be the most widely accepted answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "But before finalizing, I recall that there's also a poet named Lezama Lima. José Lezama Lima was a major figure in Cuban literature, known for his complex and dense poetry. His work is highly regarded among literary critics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, comparing Martí, Guillén, and Lezama Lima:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Martí: national hero, significant cultural impact, versatile writer.\n",
            "- Guillén: important for Afro-Cuban identity, innovative in style.\n",
            "- Lezama Lima: highly regarded by critics, complex and influential poetry.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about specific works or impacts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Martí's \"Versos sencillos\" is iconic, and his influence on Cuban identity is immense.\n",
            "\n",
            "Guillén's \"Motivos de son\" is also highly influential, especially in terms of racial and cultural identity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lezama Lima's \"Paradiso\" is a monumental work, though more known as a novel than poetry.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that, perhaps Martí and Guillén are the top contenders for the title of best Cuban poet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But if I had to choose one, considering Martí's pervasive influence on Cuban culture and national identity, he might be considered the best.\n",
            "\n",
            "But again, it's subjective. To give a definitive answer, maybe I should go with Martí based on his overall impact and recognition.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, to be fair, I should mention that there are other significant poets, and \"best\" is a matter of opinion.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that the problem asks for the best Cuban poet, and considering Martí's prominent status, I'll go with José Martí as the best Cuban poet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not entirely confident because I know that other poets like Guillén and Lezama Lima are also highly regarded.\n",
            "\n",
            "Maybe the best approach is to say that José Martí is widely considered one of the greatest Cuban poets due to his significant contributions to literature and national identity.\n",
            "\n",
            "But is he the best? I'm not sure. Maybe the most famous and influential, but \"best\" is subjective.\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps the user is looking for a name, and Martí is a safe bet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But to be more accurate, perhaps the answer should be that it's subjective, but José Martí is often regarded as the greatest.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the problem asks for the best, implying a single answer. So I'll go with José Martí.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm still not sure. Maybe I should think about literary awards and recognition.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dulce María Loynaz won the Cervantes Prize, which is a major literary award in the Spanish-speaking world. That might make her the \"best\" by some standards.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Martí is more of a cultural icon. Guillén is also highly respected.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is challenging. Maybe the best way is to list the top poets and let the user decide.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the problem asks for the best, so perhaps the most recognized globally would be José Martí.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think I'll go with José Martí as the best Cuban poet, recognizing that others like Guillén, Lezama Lima, and Loynaz are also major figures in Cuban poetry.\n",
            "\n",
            "But before finalizing, I recall that there's a poet named Virgilio Piñera. He's also significant but perhaps more known for his plays and stories.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay, after considering several names, José Martí seems to be the most prominent figure in Cuban poetry, both for his literary contributions and his role in Cuban history. So, I'll conclude that José Martí is the best Cuban poet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But to be thorough, I should mention that this is subjective and others might have different opinions based on different criteria.\n",

            "1. **Launch**: The spacecraft is launched from Earth's surface into low Earth orbit (LEO).\n",
            "2. **Translunar Injection (TLI)**: This is a burn that increases the spacecraft's velocity enough to escape Earth's gravity and head towards the Moon. It's like the first part of a Hohmann transfer orbit but adapted for Earth-Moon transfers.\n",

            "\n",
            "#### Understanding the Lunar Descent Phase\n",
            "The lunar descent phase begins after the spacecraft (in this case, the lunar lander) has been separated from the Orion spacecraft and is ready to descend from lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon.\n",
            "\n",
            "Key phases in lunar descent and landing might include:\n",
            "1. **Deorbit Burn**: The lander needs to slow down to leave its lunar orbit and begin descent.\n",
            "2. **Powered Descent**: The lander uses its engines to control its descent towards the lunar surface.\n",
            "3. **Final Approach and Landing**: The last phase where the lander touches down softly on the lunar surface.\n",
            "\n",
            "But before getting into the specifics, I need to think about the initial conditions: the lander is in lunar orbit. The altitude and inclination of this orbit will affect the descent profile.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Key Phases of Lunar Descent and Landing\n",
            "1. **Deorbit Burn**:\n",
            "   - The lander needs to perform a retrograde burn to reduce its velocity and lower its orbit's periselene (closest point to the Moon) to intersect with the lunar surface.\n",
            "   - The magnitude of this burn depends on the current orbital parametersand the desired landing site.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Powered Descent**:\n",
            "   - Once the lander is on a trajectory that intersects the lunar surface, it needs to control its descent to ensure a soft landing.\n",
            "   - This phase involves precise control of thrust to manage both vertical descent and horizontal movement towards the landing site.\n",
            "   - The lander's engines will need to counteract the Moon's gravity (approximately 1.62 m/s²) while also managing any horizontal velocity.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Final Approach and Landing**:\n",
            "   - During the final approach, the lander will need to perform a \"hover\" phase to carefully select and approach the exact landing site, avoiding hazards like rocks or craters.\n",
            "   - The landing gear will need to deploy, and the lander will need to ensure a stable, vertical orientation before touchdown.\n",
            "\n",
            "But how do we ensure the constraints are met?\n",
            "### Constraints\n",
            "1. **Minimize Radiation Exposure**:\n",
            "   - During the descent and landing phases, the crew is relatively protected by the lander's structure, but radiation exposure is still a concern.\n",
            "   - Minimizing the time spent in space, especially during solar events, is crucial. However, the descent phase is relatively short compared to the overall mission duration.\n",
            "   - Perhaps more relevant is ensuring that the trajectory avoids regions of high radiation, like the Van Allen belts around Earth (but that's more relevant for the trans-lunar phase).\n",
            "\n",
            "   For the descent phase, ensuring that the landing site is not in a region of high radiation might be a consideration, but lunar radiation is more about solar and cosmic radiation, which is hard to avoid on the surface. Maybe ensuring minimal time in transit and optimal landing times (when solar activity is low) could help.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Ensure Crew Safety**:\n",
            "   - This is paramount during the descent and landing phases.\n",
            "   - The lander must have redundant systems for critical operations like engine performance and guidance.\n",
            "   - Abort options should be available at every stage in case of system failures. For example, if the engines fail during descent, there should be a way to abort and return to orbit or at least to a safe trajectory.\n",
            "   - The landing site should be carefully chosen to avoid hazardous terrain that could jeopardize a safe landing.\n",
            "\n",
            "But how do we incorporate these constraints into the flight plan?\n",

            "\n",
            "### Phase 1: Deorbit Burn\n",
            "1. **Initial Orbit and Landing Site Selection**:\n",
            "   - Before the deorbit burn, the lander is in a circular lunar orbit. Let's assume a 100 km altitude circular orbit for simplicity (actual altitude would depend on mission specifics).\n",
            "   - The landing site is chosen based on scientific objectives and safety considerations. For minimal radiation exposure, we might prefer sites not in polar regions, as some studies suggest higher radiation at poles, but this is more relevant during surface stay.\n",
            "   - For crew safety, the landing site should be relatively flat and free of large boulders or steep slopes. Historical landing sites (like Apollo) could be considered for known safety.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Deorbit Burn Execution**:\n",
            "   - The lander performs a retrograde burn at the perilune (closest point to the Moon in orbit) to lower the apolune (farthest point) to intersect with the lunar surface near the desired landing site.\n",
            "   - The burn duration and magnitude depend on the lander's delta-v capability and the current orbit. For a 100 km orbit, the required delta-v for deorbit might be around 20-30 m/s, but exact calculations would depend on the orbit and lander specifics.\n",
            "   - This burn must be precise to ensure the landing site is within the desired ellipse of uncertainty.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Trajectory After Deorbit Burn**:\n",
            "   - The lander is now on an elliptical trajectory with the perilune close to the lunar surface.\n",
            "   - As it descends toward the perilune, the powered descent phase begins.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Phase 2: Powered Descent\n",
            "1. **Initiation of Powered Descent**:\n",
            "   - The powered descent begins at a certain altitude, say around 15 km (again, exact values depend on mission specifics).\n",
            "   - The lander's engines fire to control the descent rate. The thrust must balance the Moon's gravity to slow the descent.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Guidance and Navigation**:\n",
            "   - The lander's navigation system uses landmarks and altimetry to determine its position relative to the landing site.\n",
            "   - The descent trajectory is designed to approach the landing site at a safe angle (typically around 15 degrees from vertical at the start of powered descent,but this can be adjusted based on lander capabilities and terrain).\n",
            "\n",
            "   To minimize radiation exposure during descent, we might want to minimize the time spent in descent. This means optimizing the descent profile for minimal time while ensuring safety. However, faster descents can be riskier due to higher velocities and less time for corrections.\n",
            "\n",
            "   For crew safety, redundant systems are critical. The lander should have backup thrusters and navigation systems. Additionally, the descent profile should allow for abort options at various stages:\n",
            "   - If something goes wrong early in the descent, the lander might be able to abort to orbit by firing its engines to increase velocity and achieve a safe orbit again.\n",
            "   - As the lander gets closer to the surface, abort options might become more limited, but there should still be contingencies for engine failures or other issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Descent Profile**:\n",
            "   - The descent can be divided into several phases:\n",
            "     - **Braking Phase**: Initial high-thrust burn to slow the lander's horizontal velocity and start descending.\n",
            "     - **Approach Phase**: As the lander descends, it adjusts its trajectory to aim for the precise landing site.\n",
            "     - **Final Descent**: The last phase where the lander slows almost to a hover and selects the exact landing spot to avoid hazards.\n",
            "\n",
            "   The thrust-to-weight ratio is crucial here. The lander must have sufficient thrust to decelerate effectively against the Moon's gravity. The specific impulse (Isp) of the engines will determine fuel efficiency during this phase.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Phase 3: Final Approach and Landing\n",
            "1. **Landing Site Confirmation**:\n",
            "   - As the lander approaches the surface, sensors (such as radar or lidar) will scan the landing area for hazards.\n",
            "   - If the area is unsafe, the lander might have the capability to divert slightly to a safer spot if time and fuel allow.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Soft Landing**:\n",
            "   - The lander reduces its descent rate to near zero at the moment of touchdown.\n",
            "   - The engines must cut off precisely at touchdown to avoid tipping over or damaging the landing gear.\n",
            "   - For crew safety, the lander should land with minimal vertical and horizontal velocity (e.g., less than 1 m/s vertically and near zero horizontally).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Post-Landing Checks**:\n",
            "   - After landing, the lander performs system checks to ensure it's in a safe state (no fuel leaks, stable orientation, etc.).\n",

            "### Step 2: Earth Re-entry and Landing Overview\n",
            "Re-entry is a critical phase because it involves high speeds and temperatures. The Orion spacecraft needs to safely return to Earth after completing the lunar mission.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 3: Re-entry Corridor\n",
            "The re-entry corridor is the narrow path that a spacecraft must follow to safely re-enter Earth's atmosphere. If the angle is too steep, the spacecraft could experience excessive G-forces and heat. If it's too shallow, the spacecraft might skip off the atmosphere like a stone on water.\n",
            "\n",
            "For Orion, which is similar to Apollo in some respects but with modern technology, the re-entry corridor is typically defined by an entry angle range. For Apollo, the entry angle was around 6.5 degrees. For Orion, it's likely similar but might be optimized based on new data and technology.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 4: Heat Shield Requirements\n",
            "During re-entry, the spacecraft encounters extreme heat due to atmospheric friction. Orion uses an advanced heat shield made of Avcoat, a material that ablates (burns off) to dissipateheat and protect the spacecraft. The heat shield must be designed to withstand temperatures up to 2,760°C (5,000°F) during re-entry.\n",

            "The landing site must be chosen carefully to ensure the safety of the crew and the recovery of the spacecraft. NASA has typically used the Pacific Ocean for splashdowns due to its vast size and relatively calm waters. For Orion, the landing site is likely to be in the Pacific Ocean, near the coast of California, where recovery teams can quickly reach the spacecraft.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 6: Radiation Exposure Minimization\n",
            "During the re-entry phase, radiation exposure is less of a concern compared to other phases of the mission, such as the transit through the Van Allen belts. However, the overall mission plan must consider radiation exposure. To minimize exposure:\n",
            "- Choose a trajectory that minimizes time spent in high-radiation areas, such as the Van Allen belts.\n",
            "- Plan the mission during a period of low solar activity to reduce radiation from solar flares.\n",

            "- **Heat Shield Integrity**: Ensure the heat shield is intact and functional to protect the spacecraft and crew from extreme heat.\n",
            "- **Parachute Deployment**: Orion uses a series of parachutes to slow down the spacecraft for a safe splashdown. The parachute system must be reliable and tested.\n",
            "- **Landing Precision**: The spacecraft must be able to land within a predictable area to facilitate quick recovery.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 8: Communication Windows\n",
            "Maintaining communication with Earth throughout the mission is crucial. During re-entry, plasma formation around the spacecraft can cause a communication blackout. To mitigate this:\n",

The mission objectives are to land on the Moon and conduct scientific experiments. The flight plan must minimize radiation exposure and ensure crew safety. Let's break this down systematically.\n",

            "3. **Minimize radiation exposure**: Radiation is a significant concern in space travel, especially outside Earth's magnetic field. We need to consider the trajectory to minimize exposure to solar and cosmic radiation.\n",
            "4. **Ensure crew safety**: This encompasses everything from launch to landing, including life support, trajectory safety, and contingency plans.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 1: Understanding Orbital Mechanics\n",
            "First, I recall that a Hohmann transfer orbit is the most fuel-efficient way to transfer between two circular orbits. However, since we're dealing with Earth and the Moon, things are a bit different because the Moon is in motion around the Earth.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Translunar Injection (TLI)\n",

            "- **Purpose**: To escape Earth's gravity and head towards the Moon.\n",
            "- **Delta-v requirement**: Typically around 3.1 km/s from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). But since Orion might not start in LEO, I need to think about the initial orbit. Let's assume Orion starts from LEO for simplicity.\n",
            "- **Timing**: This depends on the launch window, which is influenced by the Moon's position relative to Earth. Optimal launch windows occur when the Moon's position is favorable for a direct ascent trajectory or a lunar orbit rendezvous.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Orion might not start from LEO. The Orion spacecraft is designed to be launched by the Space Launch System (SLS), which can send it directly towards the Moon. So, perhaps we don't need to consider LEO. Let me think about a direct ascent trajectory.\n",
            "\n",
            "But for simplicity, I'll stick with the assumption of starting from LEO.\n",

            "Once the spacecraft reaches the Moon, it needs to slow down to be captured by the Moon's gravity.\n",
            "- **Purpose**: To enter lunar orbit.\n",
            "- **Delta-v requirement**: Around 0.8 km/s to enter a lunar orbit.\n",

            "\n",
            "But again, I need to verify these numbers. I recall that Apollo missions took about 3 days to reach the Moon.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Descent and Ascent\n",
            "For landing on the Moon, we need to consider the descent phase, which involves braking to land softly, and the ascent phase to return to lunar orbit.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the problem specifies using the Orion spacecraft. Orion itself doesn't land on the Moon; it's designed for crew transfer. For landing, we'd need a lunar lander, like the Lunar Module in the Apollo missions. However, the problem states \"using an Orion spacecraft.\" Hmm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at current plans, NASA's Artemis program uses Orion for crew transport, but the landing is done by a separate lunar lander. But since the problem specifies only Orion, perhaps it's implying a direct landing capability, which Orion doesn't have. Maybe it's a hypothetical scenario.\n",
            "\n",

            "   - If we assume direct injection, then the delta-v for TLI is different. For Apollo, the TLI delta-v was about 3.1 km/s from LEO.\n",

The mission objectives are to land on the Moon and conduct scientific experiments. The constraints are to minimize radiation exposure and ensure crew safety. One specific focus is on the communication plan: how communication with Earth will be maintained throughout the mission.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Understanding the Problem\n",
            "First, I need to understand the overall mission. We're going from Earth to the Moon using the Orion spacecraft. The main goals are to land on the Moon and do some science stuff there. The big constraints are keeping radiation exposure low and making sure the crew is safe.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the communication plan, I need to figure out how to keep in touch with Earth during the whole mission. That means from launch, through the journey, while on the Moon, and on the way back.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 1: Understanding Communication Basics\n",
            "Communication in space is usually done via radio waves. The main challenge is the distance and the fact that the spacecraft is moving relative to Earth. There are a few key things to consider:\n",
            "1. **Line of Sight**: For direct communication, the spacecraft needs to have a line of sight to Earth. But the Earth is rotating, and the Moon is orbiting Earth, so this isn't always possible.\n",
            "2. **Relay Satellites**: Sometimes, we use satellites as relays to maintain communication when the spacecraft is not in direct line of sight with Earth.\n",
            "3. **Deep Space Network (DSN)**: NASA uses the DSN, which is a network of large antennas around the world, to communicate with spacecraft. This can handle deep space missions, but the Moon is relatively close compared to Mars or other planets.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 2: Mission Phases\n",
            "Let's break the mission into phases and think about communication in each phase:\n",
            "1. **Launch and Ascent**: During launch and ascent, communication is usually maintained via ground stations and tracking ships or aircraft.\n",
            "2. **Translunar Injection and Coasting**: After leaving Earth's orbit, the spacecraft is on a trajectory towards the Moon. During this phase, the spacecraft will be moving away from Earth, and direct communication might still be possible, but with increasing delay due to the increasing distance.\n",
            "3. **Lunar Orbit Insertion and Descent**: As the spacecraft approaches the Moon, communication might be tricky, especially during the descent phase when the spacecraft is on the far side of the Moon from Earth's perspective.\n",
            "4. **Surface Operations**: Once landed on the Moon, communication will depend on the position of the landing site relative to Earth. If the landing site is on the far side, direct communication with Earth is impossible, and a relay satellite would be necessary.\n",
            "5. **Ascent and Return**: Similar considerations apply during the return journey.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 3: Addressing Communication Challenges\n",
            "1. **Direct Communication**: When the spacecraft is in view of Earth, it can communicate directly with the DSN or other ground stations.\n",
            "2. **Lunar Far Side**: If the mission lands on the far side of the Moon, direct communication with Earth is not possible. We'll need a relay satellite in lunar orbit. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) or a dedicated relay satellite could serve this purpose.\n",
            "3. **Continuous Coverage**: To ensure continuous communication, we might need multiple ground stations around the Earth (which the DSN already provides) and possibly a network of relay satellites around the Moon.\n",
            "4. **Signal Delay**: Even though the Moon is relatively close, there's still a signal delay of about 1.3 seconds one way (since the average distance is about 384,000 km, and radio waves travel at the speed of light).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 4: Ensuring Crew Safety and Minimizing Radiation Exposure\n",
            "While the main focus is on communication, we can't ignore the constraints. Ensuring crew safety involves reliable communication for emergency situations. Minimizing radiation exposure might influence the trajectory (e.g., avoiding prolonged stays in the Van Allen belts), but for communication, it's more about the equipment's robustness against radiation.\n",
            "\n",

            "2. **Translunar Injection and Coasting**:\n",
            "   - Primary communication through the DSN. The DSN has stations in California, Spain, and Australia, allowing continuous contact with the spacecraft as Earth rotates.\n",
            "   - The spacecraft should have high-gain antennas for long-distance communication.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Lunar Orbit Insertion and Descent**:\n",
            "   - As the spacecraft approaches the Moon, the DSN can still be used when the spacecraft is in view from Earth.\n",

            "The Orion spacecraft is designed for deep space missions. It has a certain delta-v capacity, thrust-to-weight ratio, and specific impulse. I need to consider these capabilities to ensure the mission is feasible.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 2: Orbital Mechanics\n",
            "1. **Hohmann Transfer Orbits**: For a mission to the Moon, we don't need a Hohmann transfer orbit since the Moon is not in a heliocentric orbit like Mars. Instead, we'll use a translunar injection (TLI).\n",
            "2. **Translunar Injection (TLI)**: This is the maneuver to send the spacecraft from Earth orbit to a lunar trajectory.\n",
            "3. **Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI)**: Once the spacecraft reaches the Moon, it needs to enter lunar orbit.\n",
            "4. **Descent and Ascent**: For landing on the Moon and returning to lunar orbit.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 3: Gravitational Forces\n",
            "The gravitational forces of Earth and the Moon are crucial. The Earth's gravity will be used to slingshot the spacecraft towards the Moon, and the Moon's gravity will be used to capture the spacecraft into lunar orbit.\n",

            "### Step 4: Radiation Exposure\n",
            "Radiation exposure is a significant concern. We need to minimize exposure by considering:\n",
            "- Solar activity: Avoid periods of high solar activity.\n",
            "- Trajectory: Choose a trajectory that minimizes exposure to the Van Allen belts and other radiation sources.\n",

            "Identify optimal launch windows based on lunar alignment. The Moon's orbit around Earth is about 29.5 days, so launch windows are roughly monthly.\n",

            "Now, focusing on contingency plans:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Launch Aborts**:\n",
            "   - If there's a problem during launch, the Orion spacecraft has a Launch Abort System (LAS) to quickly separate the crew module from the launch vehicle and land safely.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Engine Failures**:\n",
            "   - **During TLI**: If the engine fails during TLI, the spacecraft might not reach the Moon. The contingency plan would involve an abort-to-orbit scenario where the spacecraft stays in Earth orbit until a rescue mission can be launched.\n",
            "   - **During LOI**: If the engine fails during LOI, the spacecraft might miss the Moon or crash. Contingency plans could include using backup engines or adjusting the trajectory to use a gravity assist from the Moon to return to Earth.\n",
            "   - **During Descent/Ascent**: If the engine fails during descent, the crew might need to abort the landing. If it fails during ascent, the crew might be stranded on the Moon. Contingency plans could include backup propulsion systems or rescue missions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Communication Loss**:\n",
            "   - If communication is lost, the spacecraft should have autonomous systems to continue the mission or return to Earth.\n",
            "   - Use backup communication systems and protocols to re-establish contact.\n",
            "   - Predefined safe states and trajectories that the spacecraft can follow autonomously.\n",

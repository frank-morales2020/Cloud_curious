            "\n",
            "**1. Transportation is Key:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **DFW Airport Transit:** DFW is huge.  Find out if his connecting flight is in the same terminal. If not, how long does the inter-terminal transportation take? Factor this into the available time.\n",
            "* **Venturing Out Options:**\n",
            "    * **Free Airport Shuttle:**  DFW might have a shuttle to nearby hotels or areas of interest. \n",
            "    * **Public Transportation:** Check for bus or train connections from the airport to the city. Research day passes for cost-effectiveness.\n",
            "    * **Ride-Sharing:**  Get an estimate for Uber/Lyft to and from potential destinations, keeping his budget in mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2.  Six Hours...Realistically:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Airport Time:** Account for deplaning, potential security checks, and getting to his next gate.  Realistically, he might have 4-5 hours for an adventure.\n",
            "* **The \"Is it Worth it?\" Factor:**  A 1-hour activity each way eats into his time. Consider if leaving the airport is worth it or if enjoying airport amenities is more relaxing.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. DFW Layover Activities - Budget-Friendly Options:**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Option A:  Stay at the Airport:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Foodie Finds:** DFW has surprisingly good food options. Research airport restaurants within his budget. Maybe try a Texas BBQ sampler platter!\n",
            "* **Hike the Terminals:** DFW has walking paths and art installations. It won't replace a real hike, but it's exercise and a way to stretch his legs.\n",
            "* **Airport Lounge Day Pass:**  For around $50, he might snag a day pass to an airport lounge. This provides comfortable seating, Wi-Fi, snacks, and sometimes drinks.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Option B: Venture Out (If Time and Budget Allow):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **The Sixth Floor Museum (Dealey Plaza):** A somber but significant museum about the JFK assassination. It's about a 20-minute ride from DFW. \n",
            "* **Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden:** (Seasonal) Beautiful gardens, about a 25-minute ride from DFW.  Check entry fees.\n",
            "* **Deep Ellum (Dallas):** Known for its murals and art scene, plus unique shops and eateries. About a 25-minute ride. Could be good for wandering and soaking up a different atmosphere.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Time Suggestion:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* If staying at the airport, no time constraints really matter!\n",
            "* If venturing out, aim for an activity that can be done comfortably within 3 hours, leaving ample buffer time.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Additional Tips for Bob:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Pack Snacks:** Airport food can be pricey. Bringing snacks helps stretch his budget.\n",
            "* **Download Entertainment:**  Load up his phone with podcasts, audiobooks, or movies for the flight and potential downtime.\n",
            "* **Research, Research, Research:**  Knowing transportation options, costs, and estimated travel times before he arrives will help him maximize his layover. \n",
